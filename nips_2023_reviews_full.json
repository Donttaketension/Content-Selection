        "value": "This paper defines the Knowledge-Grounded RL setting, a general RL setting for integrating knowledge (in the form of policies) into a policy to learn new tasks efficiently. Essentially this setting is similar to the MDP setting except that the agent is also given a set of knowledge policies to utilize. The paper also introduces a system/architecture within this KGRL setting, called Knowledge-Inclusive Attention Network (KIAN). The aim is to improve RL that is grounded on external knowledge policies. The paper outlines five desirable human-like properties they desire in their agents: knowledge-acquirable, sample-efficient, generalizable, compositional, and incremental. Moreover, they formally define these so that they are measurable within the KGRL setting (e.g., for evaluating algorithms on these dimensions).\n\nWhile previous methods typically intertwine knowledge representation and knowledge-fusion, thereby restricting their ability to adapt to numbers of policies, losing flexibility. KIAN is developed more flexibility, separating the knowledge representation and knowledge fusion.\n\nKIAN consists of three components: a policy that learns a strategy (similar to a normal policy) called the internal, embeddings that represent the given knowledge (or external) policies, a query that performs attentive action prediction to fuse the internal and external policies.\n\nKIAN also solves other issues that can occur in entropy-regularized KGRL. Entropy-regularized RL is common, but the authors show that in the KGRL setting issues can arise through entropy regularization where only a select few policies are selected, counterproductively reducing diversity in policy usage. The authors show that in the KGRL setting the agent will pay more attention to the policy with large entropy and in continuous control, will rely on the internal policy extensively. The paper introduces modifications so that this does not occur in KIAN.\n\nThe authors show results on both MiniGrid and robotics tasks and demonstrate sample efficiency, generalizability, as well as compositional and incremental learning.\n"

        "value": "In my understanding, the main idea of the paper is to waive the need to compute the SVD of A, by using random projection (RP) as a surrogate. I have the following concerns and suggestions:\n\n1. At line 220, the authors wrote that the bits per entry for SVD-quant is $O(nd\\sqrt k)$, but in Table 1 and Table 2, it is $O(k\\sqrt{nd})$. Please double check and clarify. Also, the authors simply stated that LPLR is better than SVD-quant in terms of bits per query, which is not true with some n, d, m, k (comparing the results in the table). I suggest the authors to carefully compare the results and state the regimes when LPLR is better, and when it is worse.\n\n2. In the main Theorem 3.2, $\\kappa$ could be negative, right? Is $1-c_4\\sigma_k/\\sigma_{k-1}$ bounded? Or do we need to further assume an eigen gap for this result to hold?\n\n3. I understand that the main usage of LPLR is for matrix (data) approximation, so the first experiments (Figure 1 and Table 3) make sense to me. However, for the second set of experiments on classification, why not directly using $Q(AS)$ (i.e., the quantized random projections)? This saves the storage for W (in other words, we may increase the sketch size m when using Q(AS) only). Some recent references on this include\n\nRandom projections with asymmetric quantization, Li and Li NeurIPS 2019\n\nGeneralization error analysis of quantized compressive learning, Li and Li, NeurIPS 2019 \n\nIndeed, the research on QRP is highly related to this submission, since LPLR essentially does an optimization on W to recover the data from QRP. I suggest to add some discussion on this direction in the paper and some empirical comparisons.\n\n4. Also, if LPLR is used for processing or storing the data for classification or search tasks, it might be inconvenient to handle new data points (e.g., in a streaming setting). Thus, it may not be suitable for such tasks. On the other hand, recently people are using low rank approximation in LLM fine-tuning frequently. Experiments related to fine-tuning language models could be a better application scenario for the proposed method.\n\n5. Some references on similar results are missing. A similar result as in Appendix D that $S^TQ(AS)$ with uniform quantization has approximation error independent of $d$ has been established in [EDEN: Communication-Efficient and Robust Distributed\nMean Estimation for Federated Learning, Vargaftik et al., ICML 2022] (or maybe some even earlier paper) for rotation matrix $S$. This related result should be cited. Also, Eq. (2) is a standard result for uniform stochastic rounding. A reference should be added there.\n\nIn all, I think the paper proposes a simple but intuitive method for low-rank low-precision matrix approximation from QRPs. The idea is clear, the analysis seems sufficient (despite the above and below questions).The experiments can be improved, but the current results on several tasks and datasets are convincing enough to show the effectiveness of LPLR in matrix approximation. For now, I would recommand borderline accept. "

One natural choice is to compute the SVD of the matrix and quantize the two factors independently. It's shown that quantizing the left factor first and then computing a new right factor that best approximates the input when multiplied with the quantized left factor yields much better result. The choice of SVD is not critical and could be replaced by randomly mixing the columns of the input matrix, i.e. random sketching. In fact sketching has provable benefits as the entries of sketched matrices are bounded with very high probability. This bounded range improves quantization theoretically.

The core idea is to apply discrete hue rotations to the convolution filters during the forward pass, essentially \"baking in\" robustness to color changes.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to follow. The authors motivate the problem well, explain their proposed method succinctly, and provide thorough experimentation across image datasets. The visualizations offer useful insights, confirming that the networks learn consistent features across hues.\n\nOverall, I found this to be an original and significant contribution. Invariance to hue shifts is a practical problem, and this paper tackles it through an elegant approach that outperforms regular CNNs. The concept of encoding transformations into convolutions seems powerful. While not the flashiest technique, the method is thoughtful, principled, and achieves strong results. The paper is presented clearly and comprehensively, making the ideas accessible. In summary, this is a high quality paper with both theoretical and practical value."

A general definition of color-equivariance should consider other dimensions. Maybe the claims are better justified if Hue-equivariance is emphasized in the title/introduction/method name, etc.\n2. The definition of hue-equivariance is not precise in the paper. Ideally, it should include all rotations in the RGB space (i.e., SO(3)), but also consider the fact that many of these rotations take the color values out of the RGB space (unit cube). In general, this issue occurs for the discrete subgroup $H_n$ as well. Simply projecting the color values back into the RGB space does not work as it breaks the invertibility property of these transformations. \n3. Experiments compare with a standard CNN (+grayscale) as baseline. Other baselines can be included, for example [1], that considers invariance to illumination color/intensity. \n4.

Would a better preprocessing step be only considering a canonical representation in the hue dimension?\n3. In the color-imbalance experiments, were the CNNs trained with loss weighted according to the class imbalance? \n4. Except being computationally expensive, are there other issues with using $H_n$ for higher n? Ablation in the Appendix seem to show better robustness with higher n, and also good in-distribution performance (at 0 hue shift). So I am not sure why $H_3$ alone was considered in the main paper.\n5. It would be helpful to add a few lines of summary on the ablation studies in Sec 4.2.\n6. Can experiments in Section 4.1 include CNN+jitter as it seems to provide competitive performance in Section 4.2?\n\n\n**AFTER REBUTTAL**\n\nAuthors have addressed most of my concerns, particularly, adjusted the claims regarding color vs hue equivariance and added relevant baselines. I am increasing my score as I think this paper can be an important addition to an understudied topic. \n\nHowever, I am still concerned about the mathematical definition of hue-equivariance (via H_n group) since these transformations can map a color outside the unit cube and projecting back loses invertibility requirement of a group. I accept that this may not reduce performance in practical tasks (except certain inconsistencies pointed out by the authors), but I believe it is not mathematically correct."

The challenge of usual clipping is to choose a good threshold 'R' especially for deep learning models. The authors claim that automatic clipping maintains the same level of privacy and computational efficiency as existing DP optimizers such as DP-SGD, DP-Adam, and DP-LAMB, but without the need for any DP-specific hyperparameters. In fact, automatic clipping uses a kind of normalization to bound the sensitivity of individual gradient. Additionally, they provide a thorough convergence analysis for DP-SGD with automatic clipping in the non-convex setting, demonstrating that it can match the convergence rate of standard SGD under certain conditions. The authors validate their proposal by showing that automatic clipping either matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art performance on a variety of language and vision tasks.\n"

The article lacks a conclusive experiment or statement proving that the sensitivity of the hyperparameter optimization process is easier with this method than with the re-scaled version of Abadi\u2019s DP-SGD. \n\nThe paper shows in its appendix H. that the training process of the AUTO-S method is relatively robust to the choice of $\\gamma$ on NLP tasks. However the paper doesn\u2019t compare the sensitivity of the **AUTO-S method** to the $\\gamma$ factor to the sensitivity of the **rescaled Abadi clipping** to the $R$ factor.

Is this combination of prompting and MeZo that is guiding the forward propagations ? is there a mixed cooperation between the prompt and the stochastic technique ? How much of the prompt is needed ?\n\nAnother question would be how the different techniques behave as a function of the number of examples k. It would have been nice to see a plot for some models at least between ICL , MeZo, and possible ft on the selected tasks. Why have authors stopped at 512 ? why only 16 or 512 ? there are some dataset that contain more training examples. Why didn't they compare fine-tuning and MeZo in other setups with larger examples ?\n\nThere is the relationship between the task itself and the optimiser. It is not clear to me, in which tasks this will work properly. I suspect given the prompting above that this might only work on low-perplexity tasks or task in which prompting or ICL can generate good results and not in other more complex tasks. \n\nClearly this is maybe too much to address in the paper, but all aspects above point toward the little understanding the reader is left with on under which conditions this technique can be applied. The future work seems to already assume the MeZO algorithm is working and proved, but there is just an hypotheses and a very low link between the experiment conditions and the theory. The link is stablished as \"We attribute these phenomena to the Hessian of the loss exhibiting  small local effective rank.\" . It would have been nice to strengthen this connection with some experiments or computation. Could this explain when or how this algorithm is applied ? if we remove the prompt does this increases the H effective rank ? would other tasks exhibit larger ranks ?  how can we reduce it for each of the tasks ?\n\n\nPlease, I would kindly ask the authors to read above questions and discussion as a signal of the interest the paper brought to the research field and not as criticism on their very interesting work.\n"

They provide theory to explain this fast convergence, where they show that under an assumption they call \"low effective rank,\" the learning rate scales down with the rank rather than the number of parameters.

In addition, it is well-known that performing convolutions on the spatial domain is faster and requires less memory than performing them in the Fourier domain when convolutional kernels are small O(Nk) vs O(NlogN). However, the proposed method actually relies on small convolutional kernels. These two factors call into question the computational and memory complexity of the proposed method.

Regarding the low performance of baseline models on STL-10-scale data (line 274), have the authors tried other padding schemes than zero-padding, e.g. so-called reflect/replicate/circular strategies (see the [link](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.pad.html))?

To address this gap, from prior work, we consider the down-scaling operation directly in the discrete domain taking into account of the anti-aliasing.\u201d Several grammar errors and the paragraph is unclear to me. In the first sentence, the authors write that previous works \u201cdo not need to consider anti-aliasing\u201d. But then, they aim to bridge the gap and take anti-aliasing into account. Please fix the formulation as it is currently very unclear whether previous works had an issue with anti-aliasing or not.\n\n\n- Line 103: The notation for the definition of g is unclear.
